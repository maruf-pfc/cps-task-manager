**OpsBoard** is a full-featured, internal management dashboard designed to bring clarity and efficiency to team workflows. Built as a reusable and scalable solution, it provides a centralized platform for task management, scheduling, payments, and internal communication, inspired by modern tools like Notion and ClickUp.

This repository contains the complete monorepo-style project, housing both the backend API and the frontend client application.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

This project is architected with a decoupled frontend and backend for maximum scalability and maintainability.

- **`/api`**: A robust REST API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It handles all business logic, database interactions, and authentication.
- **`/dashboard`**: A modern, fast, and interactive frontend built with Next.js (App Router) and styled with Tailwind CSS. It consumes data from the backend API.

See the README files within each directory for specific setup and technical details.
